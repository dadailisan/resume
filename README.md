#resume
Objective: to show my understanding in html and css

I've decided to use my current knowledge about html and css create my resume as a webpage. I update it once I acquired new knowledge bacic/advance. It's fun to do, even though sometimes i made mistakes on spelling and forgetting to close the html tags but in the end correcting the issues.

i might change this and use bootstrap4 as soon as i finish the documentation.
